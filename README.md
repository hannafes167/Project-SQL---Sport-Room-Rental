Project Steps:

Database Creation:
Design and create the database structure sport_booking.
Define the schema and relationships between different entities (e.g., members, pending_terminations, rooms, and bookings).

Table Creation:
Create tables for storing member information, room details, date booking, and any other necessary data.
Define appropriate data types and constraints for each table.

Altering Tables:
Modify tables as needed to add or remove columns, change data types, or update constraints.
Ensure data integrity and consistency.

Data Insertion:
Insert sample data into the tables to simulate real-world scenarios.
Use SQL INSERT statements to add records for all table.

Creating Views:
Create SQL views to simplify complex queries and provide specific perspectives on the data.
Use views to join rooms and bookings for reporting and analysis.

Stored Procedures:
Develop stored procedures to automate common tasks such as adding insert new member, delete member, update member password, update member email, make booking, update payment, view bookings, search rooms, cancel booking.
Ensure procedures are efficient and handle errors gracefully.

Triggers:
Implement SQL triggers to enforce business rules and maintain data integrity.
Use triggers to automatically update related records or perform actions based on certain events like a payment check.

Functions:
Create user-defined functions to encapsulate reusable logic.
Use functions for calculations, data formatting, for check cancellation.

make a scenario: 
A new member named Stari came to book a sports room on June 11, 2024. She booked a room of type MPF2 with a price of 60.00 for June 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM. However, soon after, Stari canceled the booking because she had another commitment on that date. Since the cancellation was made before the booking date, she was able to cancel without any issues.

Expected Outcomes:
A fully functional SQL database to manage room rentals and track member activities.
Improved understanding of SQL database design and management.
Practical experience in creating and managing database objects such as tables, views, procedures, triggers, and functions.
Ability to write efficient SQL queries and automate database operations.
